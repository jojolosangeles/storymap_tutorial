        <h3>1457-1463 COLORADO BLVD & 5110 HARTWICK ST</h3>
        <p>Mixed use 8 unit condominium with commercial offices. Rob Tyler: Architect, Tyler/Gonzalez Assoc:

            (plans handout, rendering) Mixed use project is near Trader Joe’s. Calonzo family who lived there until

            recently owns the site. We are in the middle of our building permit review and have gone through 1 public

            hearing relative to subdivision. We have been talking to Planning about the Specific Plan and codes. We are

            confident that we are in compliance. 5 different store fronts that open onto non-retail commercial spaces.

            Vehicle entry is in middle of block on Hartwick. Has 4,000 ft of parking space. 3 stories of varying heights

            due to land slope: total less than 45 feet; we are subject to transitional height, so from n/e corner to top of guard

            rail is about 9 feet high, about 10 feet from property line. Then set back 10 more feet. At n/e corner about 26

            feet, as site falls down to n/w is about 19 feet and about 20 feet back; then highest is about 36-1/2 feet. East end

            is 24-1/2 feet, and approximately 34 feet from ground to roof in back. Some units have a roof terrace. I have

            seen as many neighbors as I could and one is here tonight. We have done what we could with zoning rules.</p>

        <h3>Remembering Chavez Ravine</h3>
        <p>Chavez Ravine is a shallow L-shaped canyon located in Los Angeles, California, United States, partially in the Elysian Park neighborhood. It sits in large promontory of hills north of downtown Los Angeles and was known in the 1860s as the "Stone Quarry Hills" which had other smaller ravines such as Sulphur Ravine, Cemetery Ravine, Solano Canyon and Reservoir Ravine.[1] It is next to Dodger Stadium, a baseball venue that opened in 1962. The name Chavez Ravine can be used to mean either the actual ravine itself in a narrow sense or sometimes in a broader sense the entire promontory and surrounding ravines, and is also used to refer to the stadium. Dodger Stadium was constructed by knocking down the ridge which separated the nearby Sulfur and Cemetery Ravines and filling those two ravines in. Palo Verde Elementary School was buried in the process. Chavez Ravine was named for Julian Chavez, a Los Angeles councilman in the 19th century. Chavez originally purchased the land in the Elysian Park area, which eventually grew to about 315 acres, in 1844. Nearby "Cemetery Ravine" was named after old Calvary, the first cemetery of Los Angeles.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavez_Ravine">Source - Wikipedia</a>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Watts-towers.jpg/396px-Watts-towers.jpg">
        <p>The Watts Towers, Towers of Simon Rodia, or Nuestro Pueblo ("our town") are a collection of 17 interconnected sculptural structures within the Simon Rodia State Historic Park in the Watts community of Los Angeles. The tallest of the towers reaches a height of over 99 feet (30 m). The towers and walls were designed and built by Sabato ("Simon") Rodia (1879–1965), an Italian immigrant construction worker and tile mason, over a period of 33 years, from 1921 to 1954. The work is an example of outsider art and Italian-American naïve art.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Towers">Source - Wikipedia</a>
